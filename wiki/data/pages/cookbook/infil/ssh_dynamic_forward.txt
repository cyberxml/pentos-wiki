====== SSH -D Dynamic Forwarding (SOCKS) ======


===== Introduction =====

You can create a SOCKS proxy using the SSH '//-D//' option which creates a dynamic port forwarder on the given host. Typically, this is created on the localhost to forward to a remote server.

===== Installation =====

No installation is necessary as the standard SSH client has all the functionality required.

===== Configuration ===== 

The configuration can be as simple as including the '//-D//' option on the command line. The option takes an IP and a port number as arguments. To function properly, the login session on the remote server must have permissions to access network ports on that remote server.

===== Example Usage ===== 

<code>
ssh -D 127.0.0.1:9999 root@10.1.1.1
</code>
