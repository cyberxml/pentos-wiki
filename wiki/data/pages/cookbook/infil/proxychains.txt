====== Proxy Chains ======

===== Introduction =====

Establish a [[cookbook:infil:ssh_dynamic_forward|SOCKS SSH Dynamic Port Forwarder]] ("//ssh -D 127.0.01:9999//") to another server. 

You can connect to this forwarder with almost any tool by wrapping it in //proxychains// command.

This allows you to tunnel various network tools through an open port on a router. Ports such as 53, 80, or 3389.

===== Installation =====

The //proxychains// utility is preinstalled on PentOS. The command line wrapper is '//proxychains4//'

===== Configuration =====

Add the proxy listener defined by the [[cookbook:infil:ssh_dynamic_forward|SSH -D Dynamic Forwarding]] to the proxy list in the /etc/proxychain.conf file

<code>
strict_chain
proxy_dns 
remote_dns_subnet 224
tcp_read_time_out 15000
tcp_connect_time_out 8000
[ProxyList]
socks4 		127.0.0.1 9999
</code>
===== Example Usage =====

Run nmap through the proxychain as follows. The '//-q//' flag suppresses output from the proxychains command making it easier to read the nmap output. The //'sT//' flag enforces TCP only as the proxychain does not handle UDP traffic. This should be noted when using for DNS, SMB, or NFS traffic.

<code>
proxychains4 -q nmap -sT -n --top-ports 1000 10.1.1.1
</code>
