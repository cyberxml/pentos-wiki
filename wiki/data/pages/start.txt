PentOS is a penetration testing platform which is essentially a collection of security tools which is built over a CentOS 7, Red Hat 7, or Fedora 26 baseline. This allows PentOS (or Pentos) to be brought into environments which allow Red Hat but not other Linux variants. It also provides the tester with the ability to enumerate the security tools they are bringing to the game that are not standard OEM installs - desirable for dealing with prickly ISMs.

The PentOS Wiki which you are reading now can also be installed directly into the PentOS platform so that the recipes and lessons learned can be at your fingertips even in environments without network connectivity.
