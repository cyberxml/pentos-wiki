In one assessment, we were given credentials and an <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to a VPN gateway. The connection was initially established through a web browser which indicated it needed Java and/or Active X to configure the connection. but this only worked on certain Windows hosts.

We were able to establish valid VPN tunnels on Linux boxes by using <em>openconnect</em> with a &#039;â€“juniper&#039; flag. Openconnect acts as an HTTP client, reading the http responses, prompting for the information required in forms, and sending it all back. This worked for this connection.
